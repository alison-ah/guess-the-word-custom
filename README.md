# Guess the GenZ Slang

Yeah, it's cringe. But that's okay. 

This is an interactive “guess the slang” game using a gist API and JavaScript to test your knowledge of Gen Z slang. It is an iteration of the interactive "Guess the Word" game Skillcrush project.

## Customizations
From the original Skillcrush "guess the word" game, my customizations include:
- New interface style, including enhanced accessibility with stronger color contrast
- Custom word/slang list hosted on a GitHub gist
- Definitions displaying dynamically with a "hint" button
- Auto-populating slang spaces and special characters

## Future Development
- Mobile design: While the game's design has responsive CSS, it's not particularly user-friendly on a small screen.
- As a long-time learning designer, I'd like to create different versions that aid in learning other topics
